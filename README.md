# master.gabriels.dungeon — Production Build

- Tier‑1 UX: accessibility (focus trap, aria‑live, keyboard), password eye toggle, preload backgrounds, fetch retry.
- Tier‑2 polish: mobile haptics on consent/unlock, onboarding mini‑scroll, audio muted by default.
- Inline CSS/JS (no external paths to break).

Deploy by uploading all files to repo root and enabling GitHub Pages (main / root).
